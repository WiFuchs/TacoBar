# TacoBar
A JS web app for ordering tacos. My solution to ClickTime's intern challenge.

### Prerequisites

Make sure that you have a server to run this project from. Otherwise, the AJAX requests will be refused by the API.
I use live-server, which you can get through npm with

```
npm install -g live-server
```

### Installing

Download the two project files and place them in the directory that you will serve. Then, start serving them. For live-server, simply change into the directory and run

```
live-server
```

to start the temporary server.


You should now be able to assemble tacos to your hearts content!
